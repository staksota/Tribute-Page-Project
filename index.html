        <p id="tribute-info">The Americans and the Russians were in the middle of a very bitter Cold War and the situation escalated to the highest tensions during the Cuban Missile Crisis, where both the countries were ready to nuke each other.<br><br>

Arkhipov was second-in-command in the submarine B-59. American Destroyer ships had located this submarine and tried to force it out of deep water by dropping explosive test charges in water. These charges were not meant to harm the submarine.<br><br>

But the commander of the submarine assumed that a war had finally broken out and suggested that they launch the nuclear-tipped torpedo in their arsenal. Arkhipov bargained vigorously against this, and convinced the commander against the stupid decision. They couldnâ€™t communicate with Moscow because the submarine was too deep to receive radio comms.<br><br>

Thus, a nuclear war was averted. The Americans and the Russians had thousands of war-ready nuclear missiles ready to be launched. It would have ended the humanity as we know it.</p>
